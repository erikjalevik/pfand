# pfand

Pfand is the German word for the deposit on bottles and cans that you get back when you return them empty to the shop. Since it's often a pain to take the pfand back, this service allows you to find someone to come and collect your pfand and earn some cash. From the perspective of the collector, it allows you to register as a collector and bid on collections.
